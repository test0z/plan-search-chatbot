# plan-search-chatbot
This project is an assetized version of the general-inquiry-chatbot, originally developed by [@HakjunMIN](https://github.com/HakjunMIN), [@hyogrin](https://github.com/hyogrin) and [@YOONPYO](https://github.com/YOONPYOGitHub). It has been further developed to support users in exploring Microsoft products, comparing options, and receiving real-time assistance via a conversational interface.

## üî• New Features (6-Aug-2025)
I am excited to introduce several enhancements that significantly improve the functionality, flexibility, and developer experience of this project.

### üß† Semantic Kernel Integration
- The chatbot now incorporates [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), Microsoft's open-source orchestration SDK for LLM apps.
- Enables more intelligent planning and contextual understanding, resulting in richer, more accurate responses.
- Supports planner-based execution and native function calling for complex multi-step tasks.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Parallel Agentic Flow
- Added support for **parallel processing** within agentic flows.
- Improves performance and responsiveness during multi-function execution.
- Ideal for scenarios requiring simultaneous API calls or concurrent reasoning steps.

### üì∫ YouTube MCP Server Integration
- Supports both **MCP server** and **native API**-based function calling for YouTube data access.
- Enables seamless retrieval of YouTube content via pre-configured MCP endpoints or direct API calls.

### üîç Verbose Mode
- Introduced **verbose mode** for improved debugging and traceability.
- Logs include:
  - Raw input/output data
  - API call history
  - Function invocation details
- Helps track down issues and optimize prompt behavior.

### üé® UI Framework Selection
- Now supports both of the following UI frameworks:
  - [Chainlit](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit) ‚Äì great for interactive prototyping
  - [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) ‚Äì ideal for building and sharing web-based demos
- Choose the interface that best fits your development and deployment needs.

# ‚ú® Feature Highlights (7-Aug-2025)
Here are several powerful features included in this project that enhance search-driven LLM applications through modular design, evaluation support, and flexible UI options.

### üîÅ Query Rewrite
- A module that reformulates user queries to improve response quality and informativeness.  
- Helps the LLM better understand the user‚Äôs intent and generate more accurate, context-aware answers.

### üß≠ Plan & Execute
- Implements planning techniques to **enrich search keywords** based on the original query context.  
- Automatically decomposes **complex questions into sub-queries**, searches them in parallel, and returns synthesized context to the chatbot.  
- Boosts performance in multi-intent or multi-hop question scenarios.

### üìä Batch Evaluation
- Includes a **CLI-based batch evaluation** module.  
- Enables testing of chatbot response quality using a predefined Q&A dataset.  
- Automatically generates **evaluation reports** for quick quality checks and comparisons.

### üîÑ CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline that includes:  
  - Unit testing with `pytest`  
  - Batch evaluation execution  
  - HTML summary report generation  
  - **Slack notifications** for build/test results  
- Promotes reliable, automated deployment and testing workflows.

### üñºÔ∏è Frontend with Gradio
- Provides a lightweight [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) UI for user interaction.  
- Features include:  
  - Korean/English language toggle  
  - Query type‚Äìbased **reference question generation**  
  - Switchable `Query Rewrite` and `Plan & Execute` functionality for quick testing and demos

### üåê Multiple Web Search Options
- Supports both:  
  - **Bing Search API**  
  - **Grounding with Bing Search**  
- Allows flexible configuration depending on customer preference or available environments.



# Project Structure

The project is organized into two main parts:

- `backend`: Contains the FastAPI server and all backend functionality
- `frontend`: Contains the frontend UI

## Backend

The backend provides a RESTful API for the chatbot, handling natural language processing, search, and responses through Azure OpenAI services.

[Backend README](app/backend/README.md)

## frontend

The frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the chatbot. It is built using React and communicates with the backend API to send and receive messages.

[Frontend README](app/frontend/README.md)

## Deployment for Azure Container Apps
The backend can be deployed to Azure Container Apps for scalable and managed hosting. The deployment configuration is provided in the `infra` directory.

### Configure Environment Variables
Before deploying, you need to set up the environment variables for Azure OpenAI and other configurations.
```sh
cd infra
cp backend-env.json.example backend-env.json
cp main.parameters.json.example main.parameters.json
```

You have to fill in the `backend-env.json` and `main.parameters.json`with your Azure OpenAI credentials and other environment variables.

### ACR build

```sh
cd app/backend
az acr build -r <yours> -t <yours>.azurecr.io/plan-search-be:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT .
cd app/frontend
az acr build -r <yours> -t <yours>.azurecr.io/plan-search-fe:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT .
```

### Deploy to Azure Container Apps
```sh
./deploy.sh
```

You can see frontend url in the output of the deploy script, like this:

```sh
...
Deployment complete!
Backend URL: https://plan-search-backend.<random>.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io
Frontend URL: https://plan-search-frontend.<random>.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io
```

>[!NOTE]
> `azd` is a CLI tool for Azure Developer CLI, which simplifies above process of deploying applications to Azure. will refactor the deployment process to use `azd` in the future.
